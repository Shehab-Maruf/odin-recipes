        <h3>How to cook and serve</h3>
        <ol>
       <li>Bash out the chicken until it's all of a fairly even thickness.Put a small pan on a medium heat, then add the ground spices and toast until fragrant.Toast the spices.</li>
        <li>Whisk into the remaining marinade ingredients whisk the spices into the lemon juice and oil.</li>
        <li>then rub the mix all over the chicken and put in a sealed container in the fridge for between three and eight hours.</li>
        <li>Marinate the chicken for at least three hours.</li>
        <li>Cut the chicken into thin strips, then thread one end of each strip on to a metal skewer.</li> 
        <li>Put a second skewer through the other end of each strip, and push the strips down to the far end of the skewers, so they're tightly packed.</li>
         <li>Thread the marinated chicken on to the skewers.Heat the grill to medium and find a tray over which you can balance the skewers so they're suspended rather than touching the base.</li> 
        <li>Grill for five minutes, then turn over and grill for another five minutes the chicken should be charred and cooked through. Grill the skewers.</li>
        <li>Rest the chicken in its own juices to cool down a little while you heat any breads and prepare the accompaniments, then serve immediately.</li>
